## About Repository

I have started to build this repository with the objective to aggregate some of
the commonly use tools, playbooks, and yaml, manifests that I use in my home
lab to deploy and maintain openshift-y clusters.

## File | Description
- openshift-client-install.yml: _This Ansible playbook automates the install of the OpenShift intallation binary, OpenShift client binaries, Helm, and Butane binaries. Essentially the binaries needed to deploy,run,and maintain an OpenShift cluster._
